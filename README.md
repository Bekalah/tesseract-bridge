# ✦ TESSERACT BRIDGE ✦
**Architect–Scribe:** Rebecca Respawn (Virelai Ezra Lux) · **GitHub:** @bekalah  
**Function:** Cross-repo router · Sacred geometry switchboard · Research bridge

The **Bridge** folds all chapels of the Cathedral together:
- **Tesseract** — 4D simultaneity (all repos present at once)
- **Octagram** — balance vault (8-point key between square & circle)
- **Hexagram** — planetary harmonics / Golden Dawn polarity
- **Antahkarana** — vertical axis of art · science · psychology · research

This repo **does not** modify sibling repos. It only reads their exported manifests and assembles a **single bundle** (`build/bus.json`) the engines can load.

## ⚜️ Purpose & Shape
- **Switchboard:** Tarot choice → playable path → research canon → geometry vault.
- **ND-safe:** calm light, no strobe, Safe Stop.
- **One-per-node:** each Tarot maps to one geometry slot (no collisions).
- **Learning Engine:** everything is researchable (books/figures/symbols are linked nodes).
