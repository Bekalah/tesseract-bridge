# I Ching Sequences for Node 072

Node `C144N-072` uses three hexagram triads to echo the 72-fold harmonic weave. The sets are curated for contemplative study without divinatory theatrics.

- **Hexagram 01 · Creative Force** — anchors the bridge opening ritual; pair with angelic virtues focused on initiative.
- **Hexagram 20 · Contemplation** — offers a midpoint pause; align with infernal lessons about perspective and humility.
- **Hexagram 57 · Gentle Penetration** — closes the cycle; guides breath pacing through the helix songline study.

Each triad is broken into 24-step segments so the helix playbook can map a full 72-count practice (3 × 24). Keep notes locally in Markdown journals for offline review.
