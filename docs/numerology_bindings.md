# Numerology Bindings — Spiral Grammar for Art & Rooms
Purpose: make **every vault & image** speak your constants (21, 33, 72, 78, 99, 144, 243). No guessing. ND-safe.

## Core Idea
- **Each image/room = base geometry** (octagram, tesseract, hexagram, antahkarana) **+ numerology layer** drawn from the constants.
- **Constants = visual directives** (counts, grids, rings, petals, halos) used softly (no strobe, no noise, atelier composition).

## Visual Directives by Constant
- **21 (Pillars)** → 21 **radials** or ribs from center; use as faint guides or column rhythm in chapels.  
- **33 (Spine)** → 33 **rungs/ribs** along a central axis (Antahkarana), spaced by golden stepping; never harsh contrast.  
- **72 (Shem/Decans)** → 72 **stars/points** in a wreath; subdivide into 6 rings of 12 to keep balance.  
- **78 (Archetypes)** → 78 **micro-motifs** as subtle dotwork along a rim or tesserae band; keep opacity low.  
- **99 (Gates)** → 99 **gate dots** as a halo band; group in 3 sets of 33 to avoid clutter.  
- **144 (Lattice)** → 12×12 **soft grid** underlying the piece; align major anchors to grid intersections.  
- **243 (Seal)** → 3×3×3×3×3 suggestion via **five nested cubes or five halo tiers** (never literal flashing).

## Card → Constant Weights (for art decisions)
- **Primary spiral**: use the card number modulo the constant to choose the *dominant ring* (e.g., card 8 → ring 8 on 21-radial).  
- **Secondary spiral**: pick the next constant up (e.g., 33 or 72) to set subtle counts (ribs, stars, gates).  
- **Bridge rule**: **Fool & Hierophant** lock to **33** (spine) and **144** (lattice); **World** can invoke **243** (seal).

## ND-Safe Rendering Notes
- Never animate counts as flicker; shifts = slow, breath-paced fades (≥ 6s).  
- Light = calm volumetrics; avoid high-frequency patterns.  
- Always provide **Safe Stop** and **Intensity Slider** in interactive scenes.
