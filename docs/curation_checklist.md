# ✥ Curation Checklist — Cathedral-Grade Geometry & Numerology
Use this before any art/room goes live. One-per-node, ND-safe, no ritual theater.

## 0) Provenance & Role
- [ ] Card chosen (one-per-node) matches **liber-arcanae-game** geometry + slot.
- [ ] Lineage texts are linked in the card’s canon page (no placeholders).
- [ ] **Antahkarana Bridge** only for bridging cards (Fool, Hierophant).

## 1) Base Geometry (choose one)
- [ ] **Octagram** (balance wheel)  
- [ ] **Tesseract** (simultaneity corridor)  
- [ ] **Hexagram** (planetary harmonics)  
- [ ] **Antahkarana** (axis mundi, nave)

Confirm the same mode exists in **stone-grimoire/export/geometry_manifest.json** and the **slot** is available.

## 2) Numerology Layers (from cosmogenesis numerology manifest)
- [ ] **21** pillars/radials present (subtle), aligned to composition  
- [ ] **33** spine/rungs when axis is visible (Antahkarana emphasis)  
- [ ] **72** points in wreath (6×12), distributed evenly  
- [ ] **78** micro-tesserae band (low opacity)  
- [ ] **99** gate halo (3 rings × 33) if used  
- [ ] **144** grid (12×12) underlay, snap anchors to intersections  
- [ ] **243** seal tiers (≤5 halos or nested cubes), never flashing

## 3) Palette & Light
- [ ] Palette chosen from **stone-grimoire/export/spiral_palettes.json** set  
- [ ] Light is calm volumetric; no strobe; no high-frequency moiré  
- [ ] Safe-Stop & Intensity Slider surfaces are visible

## 4) Study & Interaction (research over theater)
- [ ] The “practice” in-scene is a real study act (puzzle/reading/arrangement), not a performance  
- [ ] Any text glyphs are legible and sourced; no invented sigils  
- [ ] Audio (if any) is optional, low, and can be muted

## 5) Accessibility & ND-Safe
- [ ] Motion ≥ 6s fades; no sudden luminance spikes  
- [ ] Color contrast supports readability without glare  
- [ ] All exits/returns marked; never trap a player

## 6) Final Gate
- [ ] One-per-node: no geometry slot collisions  
- [ ] Manifests updated (arcana/toggle/geometry/paths/realms)  
- [ ] Thumbnail ≤ 1 MB stored in repo’s `/gallery/` for docs

*If any box fails, don’t ship. Fix the manifest or composition first.*
