# Node 072 Laboratory Architecture — Living Dataset Prototype

This document describes a complete "consciousness laboratory" pattern for node `C144N-072`. The goal is to turn each node into a living research and creation environment that fuses ancestral numerology with practical tooling. The sections below outline the dataset structure, laboratory instrumentation, creative suites, and tarot egregore links that bring the node to life while staying ND-safe and offline-first.

## 1. Node Identity & Intent
- **Node ID:** `C144N-072`
- **Role:** Resonant bridge that weaves the 72-fold divine names with the 72 infernal intelligences to cultivate balance work.
- **Primary Tarot Anchor:** `LA-00` (Fool) — used because the bridge mission continues the cathedrals' pilgrimage arc.
- **Resident Egregores:** Fool Egregore (navigation mentor) and Bridge Custodian (labor steward).
- **Core Numerology:** 72 = 8 × 9. The laboratory honors the 3/6/9 harmonics and the 72-fold angelic names while remaining calm and non-theatrical.

## 2. Dataset Heaven Blueprint
Node datasets live under `registry/nodes/C144N-072.json` and are mirrored into local notebooks or canvas renderers. They are all static files so they can be browsed without a network connection.

### 2.1 Data Sections
The node JSON is partitioned into these payloads:
1. **`metadata`** — canon references, textual overview, trauma-aware intent notes.
2. **`correspondence_sets`** — cross-tradition tables: Kabbalah, Goetia, I Ching, geomancy, musical intervals, and botanical emblems. Each entry references supporting CSV/Markdown files inside `registry/maps/` or `docs/`.
3. **`pattern_fields`** — the generative constants used by renderers (vesica spacing, Tree of Life scaling, Fibonacci tuning, helix phases) with explicit numerology comments.
4. **`laboratory_tools`** — configuration for analytical apparatus (matrix explorers, harmonic calculators, gematria translator) and creative kits (canvas overlays, mandala stencils, lattice snap grids). Tools are defined as pure parameter blocks that UI modules can ingest.
5. **`experiment_playbooks`** — scripted study flows describing how to combine datasets and tools for research, creation, or divination study. Each playbook states purpose, inputs, output artifacts, and a tarot egregore prompt.
6. **`egregore_links`** — bridging phrases and dialog keys that connect to the tarot egregore memory store without automation; prompts are provided as plain text to keep the system offline-first.
7. **`offline_notes`** — safe-mode guidance, fallback palettes, and reminders to avoid overstimulation.

### 2.2 Numerology Parameters
- Use `3` and `9` as base pulse counts for rhythmic progressions.
- Keep grid overlays in multiples of `11` and `33` for alignment scaffolds.
- Fibonacci sampling uses `99` segments for smooth arcs with no strobe.
- Helix crossbars appear every `11` steps with `33` rung total to echo the cosmic helix spec.

## 3. Laboratory Instrumentation
The node laboratory is organized into four instrument bays that the renderer can toggle without animation.

1. **Analysis Bay** — houses the numerology matrix, harmonic calculator, and Kabbalah-Goetia concordance board.
   - Input: correspondences from `correspondence_sets`.
   - Output: printable tables and node-specific annotations.
2. **Geometry Bay** — renders vesica, Tree of Life, Fibonacci spiral, and helix lattice using `pattern_fields`.
   - Each layer honors the ND-safe palette and is drawn in depth order (no flattening).
3. **Alchemy Bay** — focuses on transformation experiments: combination of angel/demon pairs, color remapping, and botanical sigil layout.
   - Works with `experiment_playbooks` to produce static collage results.
4. **Reflection Bay** — conversational prompts with tarot egregores plus journaling templates.
   - Contains the offline prompts and iconography for `LA-00` guidance.

All bays run on static data and can be implemented as modular canvas or text panels with pure functions (no side effects, no animation).

## 4. Creative & Game Framework
Creative engagement happens through structured playbooks:

- **`balance_weave`** — Align one angelic virtue, one infernal lesson, and a matching I Ching hexagram. Output is a triptych card layout saved locally as JSON + PNG.
- **`vesica_palette_map`** — Overlay botanical emblems onto vesica intersections, using Fibonacci scaling to place petals. Output is a layered SVG (still static) with palette recommendations.
- **`helix_songline`** — Generate a 72-beat rhythmic grid derived from helix crossbars; produce a MIDI-safe CSV (no audio playback) and textual chant instructions.

Each playbook pairs with a tarot egregore prompt such as “Ask the Fool: which bridge rung needs reinforcement?” to keep intuition in the loop without automation.

## 5. Tarot Egregore Integration
- Egregore prompts live as structured text entries: `prompt`, `reflection_question`, `closing_grounding`.
- The renderer surfaces these prompts contextually (e.g., after completing a playbook) without triggering automatic divination.
- Dialog history is logged locally in Markdown journals stored next to the node dataset; journaling is optional but recommended for conscious tracking.

## 6. Offline & ND-Safe Considerations
- No network requests: all files are local JSON, CSV, or Markdown.
- Palette defaults match `data/palette.json`; if palette data is missing, the renderer shows a calm notice and falls back to the ND-safe scheme.
- There is zero motion, audio, or flashing content. Layer ordering preserves depth without flattening geometry.
- Every instrument bay includes a “grounding” card reminding the user to pause, breathe, and close the session gently.

## 7. Next Steps for Scaling to 144 Nodes
1. Clone the JSON template of `C144N-072` for other nodes, updating correspondences and playbooks per numerology.
2. Maintain a central manifest (`registry/ids.json`) that lists node IDs, room IDs, chapel IDs, tarot anchors, and Shem references to keep `core/check_ids.py` passing.
3. Extend `registry/maps/` with additional rows for new nodes as they come online.
4. Keep renderers modular: each node-specific palette, dataset, and playbook is data-driven so the same ES module can render all laboratories by switching the JSON input.

This architecture keeps the cathedral’s knowledge alive, interactive, and safe for neurodivergent explorers while honoring the layered geometry mandate.
