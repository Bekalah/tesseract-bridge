# Node 072 Botanical Apothecary

This apothecary list supports the Balance Weave experiments with gentle, ND-safe plant allies. Use dried specimens or printed imagery; avoid fragrances for sensory safety.

| Botanical | Numerology Link | Application |
|-----------|-----------------|-------------|
| Water Lily | 72 petal symbolism in eastern mandalas | Place petals on vesica intersections to mark angelic harmonics. |
| Sage | Bundles of 12 leaves Ã— 6 sets | Grounding smudge alternative; use visual representation only. |
| Lotus | 36 inner + 36 outer petals | Marks the midpoint between angelic and infernal lessons. |

Keep the imagery high contrast but soft in palette. Store references locally so the laboratory stays offline-first.
