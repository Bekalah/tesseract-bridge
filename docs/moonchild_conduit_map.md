# Moonchild Conduit Map — How Every Major Connects to Her

(1) Purpose — sanctuary-engine, Antahkarana as axis, ND-safe atelier.
(2) Conductor model — every card has a TEXT pin, PATTERN pin, PRACTICE pin; she translates, not overwrites.
(3) Links — one line per Major (see list above; keep one-per-node).
(4) Safety — calm light, Safe-Stop, no strobe, opt-in intensity.
(5) Provenance — geometry names & roles match your manifests; numerology constants are fixed; no placeholders.

Use this page as the reference when wiring:
- **liber-arcanae-game** (card → geometry/slot),
- **stone-grimoire** (geometry modes/renderer),
- **circuitum99** (chapter/entry),
- **cosmogenesis-learning-engine** (tone & lattice),
- **magical-mystery-house** (realm binds).

Moonchild stands at the Crossing; every card plugs into Her through three quiet pins.
