# Cosmic Helix Renderer


Static HTML + Canvas renderer for layered sacred geometry. ND-safe and offline.

## Layers
1. **Vesica field** – intersecting circles in a gentle grid.
2. **Tree-of-Life scaffold** – 10 nodes, 22 paths.
3. **Fibonacci curve** – logarithmic spiral polyline.
4. **Double-helix lattice** – two sine strands with cross-links.

## Usage
- Requires no build step or network.
- Open `index.html` directly in any modern browser.
- If `data/palette.json` is missing, a calm fallback palette is used.

## ND-safe Notes
- No motion, autoplay, or flashing.
- Soft contrast palette and generous spacing.
- Layer order preserves depth without flattening geometry.
=======
Offline HTML + Canvas demo that layers sacred geometry. ND-safe: no motion, calm palette, high readability. Double-click `index.html` to view.

## Layers
1. **Vesica field** – two intersecting circles framing the space.
2. **Tree-of-Life scaffold** – ten nodes and twenty-two paths in the classic layout.
3. **Fibonacci curve** – static golden spiral polyline, no animation.
4. **Double-helix lattice** – two sine waves with crossbars, phase-shifted but still.

Numerology constants (3,7,9,11,22,33,99,144) parameterize sizes and counts for reproducible proportion.

## Palette
Colors are in `data/palette.json`. Delete or edit to customize. Missing files trigger a safe fallback message and default hues.

## Local Use
- Requires only a modern browser.
- Open `index.html` directly; no server or network.
- If geometry ever feels overwhelming, simply close the tab (Safe Stop).

## Why No Animation?
Motion can be overstimulating. This renderer prefers stillness so attention can rest gently on layered depth.
