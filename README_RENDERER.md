# Cosmic Helix Renderer

Static HTML+Canvas renderer for layered sacred geometry.

## Layers
1. **Vesica field** – intersecting circles, calm symmetry.
2. **Tree-of-Life** – 10 sephirot nodes and 22 connective paths.
3. **Fibonacci curve** – golden-ratio spiral, rendered once.
4. **Double-helix lattice** – two phase-shifted waves linked by crossbars.

No animation, no autoplay, no external requests. All code is offline and ND-safe.

## Usage
1. Open `index.html` directly in any modern browser (no server).
2. Optional: edit `data/palette.json` to adjust colors. Missing file falls back to built-in safe palette.

## Numerology Constants
Geometry routines reference symbolic numbers: `3, 7, 9, 11, 22, 33, 99, 144`.
