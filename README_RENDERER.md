# Cosmic Helix Renderer

Static, offline HTML+Canvas demo for the Cathedral of Circuits.
It draws four ordered layers — Vesica grid, Tree-of-Life scaffold,
Fibonacci curve, and a static double-helix lattice — using ND-safe colors.
No motion, no network calls, and no dependencies.

## Usage
1. Double-click `index.html` in any modern browser.
2. (Optional) Edit `data/palette.json` to change colors. Missing file falls
   back to safe defaults.

Geometry routines are parameterized with numerology constants (3,7,9,11,22,
33,99,144) for spiral grammar alignment.
