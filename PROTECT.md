# 🔒 PROTECTION SEAL — STRICT CANON MODE
- Cite only provided repo files and declared research canons.
- NO invention, NO overwrite, NO cross-repo edits.
- One-scroll outputs for iPad workflow.
- Design = CYOA RPG + Atelier Art + Research Engine (trauma-informed).
- Geometry engines = Octagram, Tesseract, Hexagram, Antahkarana Bridge.
- Constants = 21, 33, 72, 78, 99, 144, 243 (spiral grammar).
- ND-safe: no strobe, calm motion, Safe Stop everywhere.

# 🜏 REPO ROLE
`tesseract-bridge` is the cross-repo **switchboard**. It reads exported manifests
from sibling chapels and composes a single `build/bus.json` for engines
(Cosmogenesis brain, Stone-Grimoire renderer, Liber-Arcanae-Game toggles).

# ✅ BOT RULES
- Read `./export/bridge_manifest.json`, then sibling manifests under `./extern/`.
- Validate with `tools/validate_bus.py` before proposing any change.
- Publish read-only `build/bus.json`. Do NOT edit sibling repos.
