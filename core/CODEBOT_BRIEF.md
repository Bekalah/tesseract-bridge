# ✦ CODEBOT BRIEF — Cathedral Protocol (Do Not Flatten)
- Never overwrite sacred data; prefer new files. If overwrite is essential, back up to `rescue/YYYY-MM-DD/`.
- ND-safe always: no autoplay, no strobe, motion = reduced; audio ramps gently.
- Data-driven only: read from `/data/*.json`, `/tesseract/data/*.json`, `/registry/*.json`. Do not hardcode lists.
- Provenance required: each new page cites at least one CSL item from `docs/assets/bib/citations.json`.
- Expand nodes/rooms via scripts (`build_*`, `add_*`); do not inject “demo stubs”.
- Respect numerology & mappings (144 nodes, 99 gates, 72/78, 33 spine). Keep fields intact.
- Tesseract/Chariot: step-based rotation only; no auto animation.
- If uncertain, create a proposal file under `plans/` and link sources; do not push destructive changes.
